 "Without self-discipline, we are like rudderless ships easily swayed by the currents of impulse"
 
Translation: "没有自律，我们就像没有舵的船，容易被冲动的暗流左右。"
Let's break down some key words from this sentence:

self-discipline: 自律 (zì lǜ)
rudderless: 没有舵的 (méi yǒu duò de)
swayed: 左右 (zuǒ yòu) - In this context, it means "influenced" or "controlled"
currents: 暗流 (àn liú) - Literally "undercurrent", used metaphorically here
impulse: 冲动 (chōng dòng)

The sentence uses "rudderless ships" as a metaphor for people lacking self-discipline, suggesting they lack direction and control. The word "sway" is used figuratively to mean "influence" rather than its literal meaning of physical movement.
This sentence effectively combines the concepts we've recently discussed, including "rudder" and "sway", in a metaphorical context to express an idea about self-discipline.
