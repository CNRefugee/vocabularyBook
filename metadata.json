In professional settings, a 'blemish on one's record' suggests a minor but noteworthy negative incident in an otherwise positive history. The term is prevalent in industries where appearance is crucial, such as cosmetics, manufacturing, and agriculture (for produce quality). In art and antiques, blemishes can significantly affect value. The verb form 'to blemish' implies causing damage, often unintentionally, to something's appearance or reputation. The concept of 'blemish-free' is often used as a standard of perfection in various fields. The word's use can range from everyday contexts (like skin blemishes) to more formal or literary applications describing flaws in abstract concepts like honor or perfection."

It has since evolved into a widely used idiomatic expression describing a final, often desperate attempt to solve a problem or achieve a goal. The term carries connotations of urgency, desperation, and being at the end of one's resources or options. It's commonly used in various contexts, including business (e.g., last-ditch negotiations), politics (last-ditch efforts to pass legislation), sports (a team's last-ditch attempt to win), and personal endeavors. The phrase often implies that the attempt being described is unlikely to succeed, but is being made anyway as there are no other options left. It's frequently paired with words like 'effort,' 'attempt,' or 'try.' In storytelling and media, a 'last-ditch effort' often creates tension and drama. While primarily used as an adjective, it can sometimes function as an adverb in phrases like 'fighting last-ditch.' The term's dramatic quality makes it a favorite in news headlines and narrative descriptions of critical situations."
