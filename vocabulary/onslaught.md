### Further Explanation
The word 'onslaught' carries a strong connotation of intensity and often implies a sense of being overwhelmed. Originally a military term describing a violent attack, its usage has broadened to include any situation where someone or something faces a sudden, intense, and often overwhelming force or challenge. In modern usage, 'onslaught' is frequently employed metaphorically to describe non-violent but intense experiences, such as information overload, severe weather, or a flood of emotions. It's particularly effective in conveying a sense of relentlessness or inevitability. The term is common in journalism to describe natural disasters, public reactions, or market forces. In business contexts, it might describe aggressive competition or rapid technological change. The word's forceful sound and meaning make it a powerful choice in rhetoric and creative writing, often used to create a sense of drama or urgency. While primarily used as a noun, it can sometimes be found in phrases like 'to launch an onslaught,' where it takes on a more active role.
